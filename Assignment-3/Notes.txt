unistd.h is not part of standard C or C++, it is UNIX implementation.
termios is the newer (now already a few decades old) Unix API for terminal I/O.

By default the keyboard starts in canonical mode - the input is read only when we press enter. But for the text editor we want
to run it in raw mode - that is the input gets read as soon as we press the keys.

Pressing Ctrl+D tells the terminal that it should register EOF from standard input.

ASCII character 0-31 and 127 are control characters. Pressing Ctrl+alphabetic_key removes the three significant bits from the 
key. The resulting value which is of 5 bits lies in the range 1-26 inclusive. So, we can mask out the lower five bits
from an alphabetic character to represent control character correspoding to it. Also, switching between lowercase and 
uppercase alphabets can be done by setting and resetting the fifth bit (0-based indexing).

We can send the terminal a four character escape sequence that tells it various text formatting to do. An escape sequence starts
with ESCAPE followed by '[' and two other chararcters. So, a normal escape sequece would be of the form of "\x1b[tt" where tt stands
for two characters. The various tasks that we can instruct the terminal to do are colouring the text, moving the cursor, clearing parts
of the screen.

Escape sequence terminal commands takes a command and also arguments. For example '\x1b2J'
Here '\x1b[' tells that we are entering a escape sequence and J is the command to clear the screen. The argument in this 
case is 2, which tells to clear the whole screen. If we pass 1 as the argument it will clear upto cursor and 0 would clear from the 
cursor to the end of the screen. Also, 0 is the default argument, so just '\x1b[J' would also mean to clear till the end 
of the screen. We can also pass multiple arguments wherever applicable by separating the arguments with a semicolon.
Some common command are - 
    J - Clear the screen
    H - Reposition the cursor at a given location on the screen
    C - To move the cursor right
    B - To move the cursor down
    n - can be used to get the terminal status (with arg 6 it gives the cursor position)
